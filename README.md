Which is better, network engineer or programming?
==
No matter which direction you specialize in later, the network is the foundation. At least you need to learn some NA things, and you will definitely use them. Letâ€™s talk about network engineers and programmers. In comparison, one has development in the early stage, and the other has development in the later stage. Network engineers usually have a mediocre salary at the beginning, but with the continuous improvement of technology and rich experience in doing projects, they will become more and more valuable, and there is still a lot of room for improvement; programmers usually have a relatively good salary as soon as they are trained. , but this industry has to be said to be exhausting. I wish I could type code 20 hours a day, 24 hours a day. It takes a serious toll on the body. When you are a little older, if you have not successfully transformed or been promoted to management. If you don't do it at the same level, you will have more than enough ambition but not enough energy.
